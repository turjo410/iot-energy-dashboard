## üåê Deployment

This application is configured for seamless deployment on **GitHub Pages**.

> **Note:** The `next.config.js` file is pre-configured with the `basePath` and `assetPrefix` for a repository named `iot-energy-dashboard`. If your repository has a different name, you must update these values in the config file before deploying.

The deployment is handled automatically by a GitHub Actions workflow (`nextjs.yml`) every time a new commit is pushed to the `main` branch.
